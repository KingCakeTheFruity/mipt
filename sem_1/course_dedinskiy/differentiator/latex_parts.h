"The inaccuracy problem of solving high-prioritized expressions throw Alpha-Gauss method has not been raised "
"for the past few years due to inability of derivating such because of the time span caused in 4-dimensional "
"vortex by each of variables influating a final answer.\n\n"
"A77-expression are believed to be impossible to solve in our time-space. This speculation is based on numerous tries "
"of Poenix law complementation in localy undisturbed inclosed triplecies. But recent researches uncovered the "
"unseen chances of such statement to be false.\n\n"
"This work presents a solution for a particular A77-expression found by Zenkovich A. in 2018. Using TTA and SUA"
"interminations it unfolds all the candy-peaks into numbers and variables giving us the clear vision of your mom.\n\n"

"After getting these oustanding results, let's try to abstract away a bit and think of their usability. "
"It's clearly undestandable, that in next 10 years more and more A77-expressions will be solved. "
"Judging by the latest decryption of the Bible, that's exaclty what humanity is meant to perform before "
"transcending and returning to Edem once and for all. And this work is only the begging of the newest Age of Saints."
"Thank you for the attenting and let's have a last look at this magnificent expression we got";
