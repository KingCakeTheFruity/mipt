World-wide know poem '*Onegin*' by Alexander Pushkin is commonly called 'Encyclopedian of Russian life'. But, as we all know, everything must be sorted in the alphabet order in such an knowledgeable book. Well, we can't blame Alex for forgeting those little bits, he's a writer after all, not an archivist.
So let's help him!

Task: Given a file with the pure text of the poem we are to sort its' lines in alphabetic order (ignoring punctuation) and to write it into resulting file.
